# RC_Car
A feature-rich RC car built with an Arduino, controlled by a multi-channel Flysky RC receiver. The code reads PWM signals from the receiver for proportional steering and throttle control. It also uses auxiliary channels to manage accessories like dimmable headlights, ground/back LEDs, and a buzzer with horn and siren modes.
